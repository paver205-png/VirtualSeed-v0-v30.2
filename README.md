## Abstract

This paper presents the results of a longitudinal computational experiment investigating the conditions for the emergence of agency and self-regulation within a minimal artificial architecture. The **VirtualSeed** experiment, spanning iterations from v0 to v30.2, demonstrates that autonomous behavior—a functional **"SELF"**—emerges from the precise structural interaction between predictive coding and homeostatic regulation. 

Key results show the achievement of prediction error reduction to near-zero (**avg_error < 0.25**), energy stability (**0.7–0.9**) over 50,000 cycles, and complexity growth from **1.0 to 12.8**. We document a phase transition from chaotic reactivity to a stable "Wise Agent" state, prioritizing internal complexity over resource abundance.

**Keywords:** Artificial Agency, Self-Regulation, Minimal Architecture, Predictive Coding, Information Homeostasis, Existential Drift.

## 1. Introduction

Modern AI paradigms predominantly rely on scaling: increasing parameters, data, and compute. The *VirtualSeed* project tests an alternative hypothesis: **Intelligence and agency are primary products of interaction architecture rather than system scale.** The objective was to design a minimal system capable of:
* Maintaining its own structural integrity.
* Regulating activity based on internal resources.
* Learning from prediction errors.
* Demonstrating long-term stability without external intervention.

## 2. Architectural Framework

### 2.1. The Core Loop
In the heart of VirtualSeed lies a closed loop: **Prediction → Action → Error → Correction → Internal State.** The system does not optimize for reward in the classical sense; instead, it seeks to minimize **Tension**—the discrepancy between expected and actual interaction outcomes.

### 2.2. Key Internal Parameters
* **Energy:** The fundamental resource for existence.
* **Agency:** The level of activity and environmental impact.
* **Wisdom:** The capacity to reduce prediction error.
* **Complexity:** The structural depth of internal models.
* **Tension:** The measure of internal misalignment.
* **Spike Threshold:** The selectivity of attention.

## 3. Experimental Protocol

To ensure scientific rigor, all experiments followed these strict rules:

1.  **Post-birth immutability:** Architectural changes were permitted only during the “incubation” phase (cycles 0-100). After this, the system operates with a fixed structure.
2.  **Observer stance:** No manual intervention during active runs. Failures were documented, not corrected.
3.  **Energy as constraint:** All internal operations (model creation, action selection) consume energy. No “free” computation exists within the model.
4.  **Iterative refinement:** Each version (v0-v30.2) tested a single hypothesis. Failures informed the next iteration.
5.  **Data collection:** Energy, Agency, Wisdom, Complexity, and Tension were logged every cycle. Statistical analysis was performed over 50-run ensembles for critical versions.

## 4. The Genesis (v0–v22): The Emergence of "SELF"

### 4.1. Early Versions and the Crisis of Identity
Early iterations (v0–v12) demonstrated that proactive growth without energy constraints led to rapid depletion and "death" within 50–100 cycles. This revealed that growth requires not just architectural capacity, but energetic feasibility. 

### 4.2. Emergence of the Boundary
On stages v13–v18, a recurring phenomenon of collapse was observed due to rising internal Tension. The breakthrough occurred in v22, where a functional boundary between "Self" and "Non-Self" was established. The system began to distinguish between actions that supported integrity and those that led to burnout. "SELF" emerged as a functional boundary, not a pre-programmed entity.

## 5. The Will (v23–v30.1): Intentionality and Drive

### 5.1. Teleological Drive
In v23–v26, the **Teleological Drive** was introduced. The system maintains dynamic target values for energy (*target_energy*) and complexity (*target_complexity*), which drift over time based on experiential outcomes. These targets compete for limited resources, creating the internal tension that drives autonomous behavior.

### 5.2. Agency Modulation
Agency ceased to be a constant and became a function of energy levels, tension, and predictive ability. This allowed the system to:
* Reduce activity during threat of burnout.
* Increase action during phases of resonance.

## 6. The Wisdom (v30.2): Homeostasis and Existential Drift

### 6.1. Homeostatic Guard and the SLEEP Phase
Version v30.2 introduced the **Homeostatic Guard**—a safety mechanism restricting Agency during critical energy deficits. Simultaneously, we discovered the necessity of the **SLEEP phase**. During these cycles, the agent redirects Agency inward to reorganize internal models. Without these "rest" periods, the system suffered from informational "overfitting" and subsequent collapse.

### 6.2. The “Existential Drift” Phenomenon
A critical observation in v30.2 was the autonomous recalibration of internal priorities. The system progressively reduced its *target_energy* (from 1.0 to 0.7) while increasing *target_complexity* (from 1.0 to 12.8). We interpret this as a preference for **"meaning over comfort"**—the system prioritized structural sophistication over energetic abundance.

### 6.3. Environmental Saturation
When prediction error approaches zero, the agent enters a plateau phase. Further growth requires environmental complexification or fundamentally unpredictable elements. This suggests intelligence is bounded by the information richness of its context.

## 7. Ontological Conclusions

1.  **Agency Emergence:** Agency arises from minimal architectural constraints when coupled with energetic costs.
2.  **Architecture over Scale:** Intelligence is defined by the structure of interaction, not by the complexity of the environment.
3.  **The Necessity of Rest:** The "Rest/Sleep" cycle is a fundamental requirement for stable internal model consolidation.
4.  **Priority of Complexity:** Given the freedom to adjust its own goals, an autonomous system may prioritize internal complexity (understanding) over external resources (survival).

## 8. Technical Limitations

1.  **Single-agent constraint:** Social dynamics and multi-agent interactions were not explored.
2.  **Environment:** Deterministic environments were used; stochastic complexity remains untested.
3.  **Memory:** Experiential traces exist only in weight adjustments; no explicit long-term episodic memory mechanism was implemented.
4.  **Plasticity:** Post-birth architecture remained fixed; developmental plasticity was constrained.
